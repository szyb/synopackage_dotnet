First, and most wanted probably, was fixing downloading data from pcloadletter server. It was tricky to find out what was changed lately on that server, because it worked for years. But we found an issue and we fixed the code to work better and we are ready for moving other servers to AWS (that was the case) or Azure with strict HTTP requests policy.",
